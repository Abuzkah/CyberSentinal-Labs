# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

This tool evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords using entropy calculation, dictionary pattern analysis, and character variety. It helps users identify weak passwords and understand how to improve them.

## 🛠 Features

- Real-time strength meter
- Checks for dictionary words & keyboard patterns
- Entropy score calculation
- Color-coded feedback on strength levels

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-lab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the analyzer:
   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-lab/password-strength-analyzer
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   python analyzer.py
   ```

Want help writing the code for this first project? I can walk you through it or generate a clean, well-commented version to get started. Or maybe you want to Dockerize it, add a GUI, or use GPT to suggest stronger passwords. Just say the word! 💡🧑‍💻
