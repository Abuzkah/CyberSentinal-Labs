# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

This tool evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords using entropy calculation, dictionary pattern analysis, and character variety. It helps users identify weak passwords and understand how to improve them.

## 🛠 Features

- Real-time strength meter
- Checks for dictionary words & keyboard patterns
- Entropy score calculation
- Color-coded feedback on strength levels

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abuzkah/CyberSentinal-labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the analyzer:
   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-lab/password-strength-analyzer
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   python analyzer.py
   ```

## 📸 Demo

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Password: ilove123
Strength: Weak
Suggestions: Avoid common words, add symbols and uppercase letters.
```

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

For educational use only. Do not use this tool to analyze passwords you do not own.
